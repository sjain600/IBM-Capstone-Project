I am working as a data scientist for a new company called SpaceY. Space Y, which would like to compete with SpaceX, was founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. 
Our job is to determine the price of each launch. We will do this by gathering information about SpaceX using the SpaceX API and creating dashboards for our team. 
I will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of relying on rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, 
I will train a machine learning model and use publicly available information to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
